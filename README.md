## API Integration

- **Dio**: Used for making HTTP requests to fetch data from the API. Dio provides a clean and efficient way to handle network requests with features like interceptors, timeouts, and error handling, ensuring robust communication with the backend.

## Testing

- **Unit Testing**: Utilizes `mockito` to mock dependencies and test business logic in isolation, ensuring core functionality works as expected.
- **Widget Testing**: Tests Flutter widgets to verify UI components render correctly and respond to user interactions.
- **Bloc Testing**: Uses `bloc_test` to test Bloc states and events, ensuring state management logic is robust.
- **Mocked API Testing**: Employs `http_mock_adapter` to simulate API responses, allowing for reliable testing of network-dependent features without hitting the actual API.
